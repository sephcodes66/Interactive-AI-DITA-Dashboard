# Interactive AI DITA Dashboard
 This project is a full-stack web application designed to demonstrate a modern, AI-enhanced documentation workflow. It provides a user-friendly dashboard where raw text or uploaded files (.txt, .md) can be instantly transformed into high-quality, standards-compliant DITA XML. The application leverages a Python Flask backend for processing and a dynamic frontend to visualize the results, including AI-generated metadata and content analysis.

The application provides a seamless experience for transforming unstructured text into valuable, structured DITA content.

- Simple and Clean Input Interface:
The user is greeted with a clean interface where they can either paste raw text or upload a file.

- AI-Powered Analysis and Visualization:
After processing, the dashboard dynamically displays the results. This includes a concise summary and relevant keywords generated by the AI, alongside a Plotly chart that visually analyzes the contentâ€”in this case, the frequency of the AI-generated keywords within the improved text.

- High-Quality DITA XML Output:
The final, primary output is a well-structured, compliant DITA XML topic. The content has been automatically improved for quality and enriched with the generated metadata in the <prolog> section, ready for use in any Component Content Management System (CCMS).

## Key Features
### Interactive Web Interface: 

- A clean, modern UI built with HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS allows for easy interaction via text input or file upload.

- AI-Powered Quality Enforcement: Uses the Google Gemini API to function as an automated technical editor, rewriting source text to improve clarity, voice, and tone.

- Automated DITA Generation: Converts the AI-improved text into a well-structured and valid DITA topic, including a proper prolog, title, and body.

- Intelligent Metadata Extraction: Makes further calls to the AI to generate a concise <shortdesc> summary and a list of relevant <indexterm> keywords, which are crucial for content reuse and findability.

- Visual Content Analysis: Features an interactive dashboard built with Plotly.js that visualizes key metrics of the generated content.

- Full-Stack Architecture: Built on a robust Flask (Python) backend that handles all business logic, file processing, and API calls, serving data to a dynamic JavaScript frontend.

## Tech Stack
### Backend:

- Python 3+
- Flask: For the web framework and API endpoints.
- Google Generative AI SDK: To connect with the Gemini API.
- Plotly: For generating data visualizations on the server.
- Dotenv: For managing environment variables securely.
- Frontend:
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling.
- JavaScript (vanilla): For DOM manipulation and API communication (fetch).
- Plotly.js: To render the interactive charts received from the backend.
- Prism.js: For beautiful, readable syntax highlighting of the generated XML.

## How It Works
- The application follows a clear client-server workflow:
- User Input: The user enters raw text into the textarea or uploads a .txt/.md file.
- API Request: The frontend JavaScript sends this data to the appropriate API endpoint (/process or /process_file) on the Flask server.
- The Flask backend receives the text.
- It first sends the text to the Gemini API with a "technical editor" prompt to get a structurally improved version.

- It then sends the improved text to the Gemini API two more times to generate a summary and a list of keywords.

- The backend constructs a valid DITA XML string from the improved content and metadata.

- It uses Plotly to generate a chart analyzing the content (e.g., keyword frequency).

- JSON Response: The server packages the final DITA XML, summary, keywords, and the Plotly chart JSON into a single JSON object and sends it back to the client.

- Dashboard Rendering: The frontend JavaScript parses the JSON response and dynamically updates the dashboard, displaying the metadata, rendering the Plotly chart, and showing the final DITA XML with syntax highlighting.

- Setup and Installation
- To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- An active Google AI (Gemini) API Key.

1. Clone the Repository
    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Smart_Dita_Factory.git
        cd Smart_Dita_Factory
    ```


2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
    ### For Mac/Linux
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    ### For Windows
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install Dependencies
- Install all the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure Environment Variables
- Create a file named .env in the root of the project directory. This file will hold your secret API key.
    ```bash
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
5. Run the Flask Application
- Start the development server with the following command:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## How to Use
- Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```
- The dashboard will load with sample text in the input area.
- Click the "Process with AI" button, or choose a local .txt or .md file to upload.
- The application will process the content and display the AI-generated DITA XML, metadata, and the interactive chart on the dashboard.
